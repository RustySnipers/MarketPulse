# Project Review: Market Pulse

This document outlines identified bugs, unfinished features, and areas for improvement in the Market Pulse application. Issues are categorized by severity to guide development efforts.

## Completed Issues

### 1. **Fatal Error in Live Trading Due to Mismatched ML Model Features**
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Status:** **Fixed**
- **File:** `trading.py`
- **Description:** The live trading `on_tick` function was creating a pandas DataFrame with features that did not match what the machine learning model was trained on.
- **Resolution:** The `on_tick` function was updated to calculate the correct technical analysis features before making predictions.

### 2. **Backtesting Module Not Implemented**
- **Severity:** High
- **Status:** **Fixed**
- **File:** `backtesting.py`
- **Description:** The backtesting module was not performing a proper backtest and was instead retraining the model on the test data.
- **Resolution:** The `run_backtest` function was refactored to use the `backtrader` library with a pre-trained model to simulate a realistic backtest.

### 3. **Unsafe Credential Storage**
- **Severity:** High
- **Status:** **Fixed**
- **File:** `gui.py`, `webull_integration.py`, `tradingview_integration.py`
- **Description:** Usernames were being stored in plain text in the settings file.
- **Resolution:** The application now stores usernames in the system keychain, alongside passwords, for improved security.

### 4. **Inefficient Per-Tick DataFrame Creation**
- **Severity:** High
- **Status:** **Fixed**
- **File:** `trading.py`
- **Description:** The live trading module was creating a new pandas DataFrame for every market tick, leading to high memory usage.
- **Resolution:** The trading module now maintains a rolling window of tick data, which is much more memory-efficient.

### 5. **No Error Handling for IB TWS Connection**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** **Fixed**
- **File:** `trading.py`
- **Description:** The `start_trading_bot` function was attempting to connect to Interactive Brokers TWS without any error handling.
- **Resolution:** The `ib.connect()` call is now wrapped in a `try...except` block to handle connection errors gracefully.

### 6. **Multiple Trading Threads Can Be Started**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** **Fixed**
- **File:** `gui.py`
- **Description:** The "Start Trading" button could be clicked multiple times, leading to multiple trading threads.
- **Resolution:** The "Start Trading" button is now disabled when trading is active.

### 7. **Unused `self_improve_model` Function**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** **Implemented**
- **File:** `gui.py`, `trading.py`
- **Description:** The `self_improve_model` function was unused.
- **Resolution:** An "Improve Model" button was added to the GUI to allow users to retrain the model with new data.

### 8. **Blocking GUI Calls**
- **Severity:** Low
- **Status:** **Fixed**
- **File:** `dialogs.py`, `gui_trading.py`, `gui_integrations.py`
- **Description:** The use of `simpledialog` and `messagebox` could block the main GUI thread.
- **Resolution:** Custom non-blocking dialogs were created and implemented, preventing the GUI from becoming unresponsive.

### 9. **Monolithic GUI Class**
- **Severity:** Low
- **Status:** **Fixed**
- **File:** `gui.py`, `gui_data_analysis.py`, `gui_trading.py`, `gui_integrations.py`
- **Description:** The `TradingBotApp` class was very large and handled all aspects of the GUI.
- **Resolution:** The `TradingBotApp` class was refactored into smaller, more focused components, improving code readability and maintainability.

All identified issues have been addressed.
