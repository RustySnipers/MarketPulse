# Future Enhancements for Market Pulse

This document outlines potential future enhancements and features for the Market Pulse application, with a focus on improving the TradingView integration.

## TradingView Integration Enhancements

### 1. **Dynamic Chart Symbol Updates**
- **Description:** The TradingView chart should automatically update to a new symbol when a user types a new ticker in the "Enter Ticker" field and presses Enter, or when they select a symbol from their watchlist or portfolio.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - The `open_chart` method in `tradingview_integration.py` will need to be modified to accept a symbol and reload the webview with the new chart URL.
    - The GUI will need to be updated to trigger this method when the ticker changes.

### 2. **Chart Time-Period Control**
- **Description:** Users should be able to change the time period (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day) of the TradingView chart directly from the application.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - A new dropdown menu or set of buttons will be added to the GUI to select the desired time period.
    - The `open_chart` method will be updated to include the time period in the chart URL. For example: `https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=AAPL&interval=60` for a 1-hour interval.

### 3. **Pine Script Indicator Management**
- **Description:** Provide users with the ability to add, remove, and configure Pine Script indicators on the TradingView chart from within the Market Pulse application.
- **Research Findings:**
    - TradingView's charting library allows for the addition of custom indicators via its API. We can leverage this to allow users to manage their indicators.
    - The `webview` library can execute JavaScript, which will be necessary to interact with the TradingView chart's API.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - A new "Indicators" button will be added to the GUI, which will open a dialog for managing indicators.
    - The dialog will allow users to:
        - Add a new indicator by providing its name or ID.
        - Remove an existing indicator from the chart.
        - Configure the parameters of an indicator (e.g., changing the length of a moving average).
    - The `TradingViewSession` class will be extended to include methods for interacting with the chart's JavaScript API to perform these actions.

### 4. **Proper Symbol Name Generation**
- **Description:** Ensure that symbol names are correctly formatted for the TradingView chart URL. For example, stock tickers should be prefixed with their exchange (e.g., `NASDAQ:AAPL`).
- **Implementation Details:**
    - A utility function will be created to map common tickers to their correct TradingView format.
    - This function will be used whenever a new chart is opened to ensure the symbol is recognized correctly.

## Other Potential Enhancements

- **Real-time Profit/Loss Tracking:** Display the real-time profit or loss for open positions.
- **Advanced Order Types:** Support for more advanced order types, such as stop-loss and take-profit orders.
- **Historical Performance Analysis:** Provide more in-depth analysis of historical trading performance, including metrics like win/loss ratio, average gain/loss, and more.
- **Strategy Customization:** Allow users to customize the trading strategy used by the bot, such as by selecting different indicators or adjusting their parameters.
